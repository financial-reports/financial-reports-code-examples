    "\n",
    "This is a powerful workflow that demonstrates the value of the FinancialReports data dump. It answers the question: **\"Now that I've loaded my metadata into a database, what can I do with it?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will:\n",
    "1. Connect to the SQLite database created by the `load_to_sqlite.py` script.\n",
    "2. Query for a specific subset of filings (e.g., all annual reports).\n",
    "3. For each filing, read its corresponding local markdown file.\n",
    "4. Calculate its Gunning Fog readability score using our reusable analysis function.\n",
    "5. Display the results in a sorted table and visualize the distribution of scores."
