# Excerpt from Fictitious Annual Report 2024

## Business Outlook

The fiscal year 2024 presented significant headwinds, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. Despite these challenges, the company successfully maintained a flat revenue growth, which, while not meeting our initial targets, demonstrates operational resilience.

Looking ahead to 2025, we are cautiously optimistic. Our strategic pivot to the 'Phoenix' product line is showing promising early adoption rates. We project a modest 5-7% growth for H1 2025. However, regulatory uncertainty in the DACH region remains a considerable risk, and we are allocating a $1.5M contingency fund to address potential compliance costs.
