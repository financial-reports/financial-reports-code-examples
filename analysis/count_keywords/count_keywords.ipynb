    "\n",
    "A common and powerful analysis technique is to track the frequency of specific keywords in financial reports over time. This can help identify trends, measure focus on strategic initiatives (like \"AI\" or \"ESG\"), or flag risk-related terms (like \"inflation\" or \"supply chain disruption\").\n",
