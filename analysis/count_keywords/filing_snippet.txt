Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to a number of assumptions, uncertainties, and risk factors. A primary risk is the ongoing global inflation, which impacts our cost structure and consumer purchasing power. We are actively mitigating this risk through strategic sourcing and operational efficiencies.

Furthermore, our supply chain continues to experience volatility. The company's commitment to sustainability and ESG principles remains a core part of our strategy, influencing our long-term investment in greener supply chain solutions. This includes leveraging AI to optimize logistics and reduce our carbon footprint. The adoption of AI also presents a new category of operational risk that we are closely monitoring. The board believes our proactive stance on ESG and technology will yield significant competitive advantages. We face a high risk of disruption if the supply chain issues are not resolved.
